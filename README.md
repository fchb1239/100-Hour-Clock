# 100 Hour Clock
More precise, more effecient, less confusion.

I'll be posting a program soon when I have the names for the different times,
since if I called an hour in the new system the same as the old one, it would cause confusion.

# Why?
Good question.
I thought to myself one day while I was eating breakfest, I looked at the time and I had to be out the door by 7.
Which made my wonder, why have 24 hours in a day?

Who should I be asking though?

The ancient egyptians aren't really around anymore.

# Yes, but why?
Let's compare 24 hour time to imperial measurement system.
Imperial it confusing, and is illogical, good for it's time, but not good for accuracy.
Then metric came along and solved that problem.

But we still have 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute, 10 deciseconds in a second and so on.
Which is quite frankly, also illogical.

# Solution
100 hour clock system. 100 hours in a day, 100 minutes in an hour, 100 seconds in a minute.
You can also view it as a percentage, 100 hours in a day also signify how much percentage has passed during the day.
It's simple, and more logical.

As to not cause confusion, this clock system will be using Cycle, Moment, and Beat.
There are 100 Cycles in a day
100 Moments in a Cycle
100 Beats in a Moment

# Examples
- "Hey, meet me at 50" - The person saying this wants to meet someone at the middle of the day (12 o' clock)
- "Want to grab a drink at 80" - The person wants to meet up in the evening, when 80% of the day has passed
- "I can't wake up at 35, it's too early!" - This would be early sunrise, and would be annoying to wake up at.
- "I'll be there in a moment" - This is equivalent to "I'll be there in a minute"
